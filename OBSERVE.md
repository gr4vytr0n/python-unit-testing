The rules for Roman numerals lead to a number of interesting observations:
1. There is only one correct way to represent a particular number as a Roman numeral.
2. The converse is also true: if a string of characters is a valid Roman numeral, it represents only one number
(that is, it can only be interpreted one way).
3. There is a limited range of numbers that can be expressed as Roman numerals, specifically 1 through 3999 .
The Romans did have several ways of expressing larger numbers, for instance by having a bar over a numeral
to represent that its normal value should be multiplied by 1000 . For the purposes of this chapter, letâ€™s
stipulate that Roman numerals go from 1 to 3999 . I am only going to 10 in my practice code.
4. There is no way to represent 0 in Roman numerals.
5. There is no way to represent negative numbers in Roman numerals.
6. There is no way to represent fractions or non-integer numbers in Roman numerals.
